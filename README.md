# hello-world
Student Project From Santa Rosa Junior College
I almost completely new to the web server/hosting "business". I understand HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript but I am still learning and trying to understand terminology such as Server Hosting Space, DNS, repositories, File Transfer Protocol, etc. It is a bit overwhelming for me at the moment. I am trying to succeed in my intermediate Web Dev class. Hopefully all goes well and I learn a lot by the end. In the mean time bear with me while I take my time to learn this...system for building websites.
